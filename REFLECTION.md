# Can I explain what my code does?
    - My code creates a basic html webpage based on my resume

# What was my coding process?
    - I separated my resume into different sections and did each separately

# What challenges did I have?
    - it was difficult to remember all the HTML syntax

# What would I do differently now?
    - Ensure Accessibility as soon as I add any image instead of having to go back and fix it later.
